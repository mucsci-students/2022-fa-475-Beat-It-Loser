Due to large file sizes, the project would not upload to GitHub.

The entire project, along with executables, is hosted on a Google Drive.

**Windows version:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k7eSvWzYxfX0yhGA9TE05L0U0NAYf-dx/view?usp=sharing

**Mac version:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GckgN8TMXfOxn13W-moQ1TgY_1i3jQgo/view?usp=sharing

## For both versions

Extract the archive into your desired location. Double click the executable to run.

Use **D F J K** keys to hit each cube as it passes over the bar. Hit the yellow notes to build your special meter and at 100% activate it with **Spacebar** to fill your health and double your combo for a short time.

Post your high scores in the Game Dev Discord!


Troubleshooting:

If the game freezes after selecting a song, make sure the 6 .txt song files are in the same directory as the executable.
